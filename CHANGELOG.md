## [Unreleased] - TBD

weather is a command line tool that displays the current weather in the terminal.
It queries the OpenWeather API for data, then shows it with optional (256) colors.
It currently requires [Nerd Fonts] to be installed.

* Requires the `-k/--key` option to choose the OpenWeather API key
* Requires the `-l/--location` option to choose the location (text or `lat,lon`)
